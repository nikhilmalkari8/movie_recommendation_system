# Popularity Based Model

```
The goal of this recommendation model is to first choose the movies with the highest ratings. 

Once the popular movies have been extracted, I fetch the movies that havent been rated by the given userId yet.

This model suggests those popular movies that have not been rated by that particular user yet.

Presumably, if a movie is not rated by an user it has not been seen by the user as well.
